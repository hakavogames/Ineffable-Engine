        that i, which is the index, to be rigidly less than 6)
        
        Then, for every index I added to the clip's frames Array a TextureRegion from my tileset. I had to
        use the method createTextureRegion() because the tiles Array is an Array of Tile objects so I had to
        convert the Tile to a TextureRegion in order to add it to the clip's frames Array

        The default value for this variable is 1 so you don't need to change it if you want

            -tiled background
            -texture background

        powerful things such as ParallaxScrolling
        
        ParallaxScrolling is how the background that looks to be further moves slower as you move than the one closer.
        It is usually used at WebPages but it also allows for some cool effects in games

        make exactly the same background of the TestGameMode GameMode because I'm lazy
